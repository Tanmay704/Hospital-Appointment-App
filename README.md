Hospital-Appointment-App

"Hospital Appointment App" is a Java Spring Boot web application with MySQL database and Thymeleaf as the view engine. The application allows patients to schedule an appointment with a specific doctor and the doctors can view their appointment schedules from a separate login interface.

The application has two main interfaces - one for patients and another for doctors. Patients can select a doctor, choose a convenient date and time, and schedule their appointment. They can view their appointment details, cancel or reschedule their appointment from their interface. Doctors can log in to the application and view their upcoming appointments, and mark appointments as completed once the consultation is over.

The backend of the application is implemented using Java Spring Boot, with Spring Security providing authentication and authorization for different user roles. The application uses MySQL database to store patient and doctor details, appointment schedules, and related information. Thymeleaf is used as the view engine to render the HTML pages for the user interfaces.

Overall, "Hospital Appointment App" provides an easy-to-use, efficient solution for patients to schedule appointments and doctors to manage their schedules, enhancing the overall patient experience at the hospital.
